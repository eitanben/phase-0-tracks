# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
is a way to control changes made to a file.  it is very useful when the file is not producing the results required.  a programmer can have a look at the last change of that script. good for maintenance.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch is pointer to a future commit.  it is a new instance (sounds like), its used to make changes to a script.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
record the changes made to the repository. a good message will be the reason what the change was: "updated the interest calculation from a monthly to a daily compounded"
* What is a merge conflict?
it could happen when 2 people change the same thing on the same file.
